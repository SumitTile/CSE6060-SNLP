YouTube is an American online video-sharing platform headquartered in San Bruno, California. Three former PayPal employees—Chad Hurley, 
Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim—created the service in February 2005. Google bought the site in November 2006 for US$1.65 billion; YouTube now
 operates as one of Google's subsidiaries.

YouTube allows users to upload, view, rate, share, add to playlists, report, comment on videos, and subscribe to other users. It offers a
 wide variety of user-generated and corporate media videos. Available content includes video clips, TV show clips, music videos, short and 
documentary films, audio recordings, movie trailers, live streams, and other content such as video blogging, short original videos, and 
educational videos. Most content on YouTube is uploaded by individuals, but media corporations including CBS, the BBC, Vevo, and Hulu 
offer some of their material via YouTube as part of the YouTube partnership program. Unregistered users can only watch (but not upload) 
videos on the site, while registered users are also permitted to upload an unlimited number of videos and add comments to videos. Videos 
that are age-restricted are available only to registered users affirming themselves to be at least 18 years old.
