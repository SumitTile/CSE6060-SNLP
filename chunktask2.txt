Space Exploration Technologies Corp., trading as SpaceX, is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company
 headquartered in Hawthorne, California. It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs to
 enable the colonization of Mars. SpaceX has developed several launch vehicles, the Starlink satellite constellation, and 
the Dragon spacecraft.

SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit (Falcon 1 in 2008), the first
 private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft (Dragon in 2010), the first private company to send a spacecraft
 to the International Space Station (Dragon in 2012), the first propulsive landing for an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2015), the 
first reuse of an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2017), the first private company to launch an object into orbit around the Sun (Falcon
 Heavy's payload of a Tesla Roadster in 2018), and the first private company to send astronauts to the International Space Station 
(Dragon 2 in 2020). SpaceX has flown 20[15] cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station (ISS) under a partnership 
with NASA,[16] as well as an uncrewed demonstration flight of the human-rated Dragon 2 spacecraft (Crew Demo-1) on March 2, 2019, and 
the first crewed Dragon 2 flight on May 30, 2020.
